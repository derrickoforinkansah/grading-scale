# grading-scale
My school's grading System (UCC)
Letter Grade Calculator (Python)
### Overview

This project is a simple Python function that converts a numerical score (mark) into a letter grade based on a predefined grading system.

It is useful for:

- Students learning Python
- Basic conditional logic practice
- Academic grading automation
- Mini projects and demos

### Grading System
The function assigns grades as follows:
- Mark Range	Letter Grade
- 80 and above -->	A 
- 75 – 79 -->	B+
- 70 – 74 -->	B
- 65 – 69	--> C+
- 60 – 64	--> C
- 55 – 59	--> D
- 50 – 54	--> D+
- Below 49 -->	E

### Important Note for Users
The value:
mark = 91
is just an example.
To use this for your own result, change the value:
mark = 67
or any score you want to evaluate.

### Academic Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- Conditional statements
- Function creation
- Return values
- Simple input-output logic

It is suitable for:
- Intro to Python courses
- Programming assignments
- Mini projects
- GitHub portfolios
